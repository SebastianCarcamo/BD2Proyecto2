# Project 2 - Data Bases II

In this project we will build a secondary memory index for tweets, and build a search engine for term search, for similar tweets retrieval.

## Tweet Processing

We first process each Tweet independently in order to tokenize and remove stop words and miscellaneous character as punctuation signs and emojis. From here, each term is ready to generate the document frequency.


## TFIDF Scoring


## Web Browser

In order to build a web application for our search engine we used Django Web Framework. As this is a Python framework,it is completely compatible with our Python index. In order to search we just created an API endpoint to call the function that retrieves the similar tweets.
